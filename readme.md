# Section 3 - Bowling Assets
**A bowling ball and bowling pin to demonstrate more mesh concepts, and very simple materials.**

Part of the Complete Blender Creator course on Udemy, see [here](https://www.udemy.com/blendertutorial/?couponCode=GitHubSpecial) for a special GitHub offer. The full course is part of [this](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bentristem/how-to-create-3d-assets-using-blender-online-cours) Kickstarter campaign which was 1000% funded.

These are just the files from the course, not the actual tutorial vidoes. At the time of writing this course has several hours of high-quality videos.

You're welcome to download, fork or do whatever else legal with all the files!

Enjoy yourselves.

## Lean Production Pipeline
* Introducing lean production / rapid prototyping.
* NOT pre-production, production, post-production.
* Imagine these assets are for a bowling game.
* Knowing how fast / how many iterations to do.
* Knowing when to stop iterating!

## Knowing Your Topic and Specification
* Understanding your subject.
* Planning your model.
* Know the importance of research.

## Blender Model Scale
* From around 0.01BU to 100BU.
* Blender doesn’t work well outside this range.
* Rule of thumb, use the grid floor as a stage.
* Pick an order of magnitude suitable for the level of detail.

## Importing Reference Material
* There are 2 ways of importing reference material.
* Background images and textured planes.
* We’ll be using background images.

## Choosing The Right Primitive(s)
* Starting with a primitive with the same symmetry and shape as your target model saves you time.
* It can be very hard to remove all traces of the original shape.

## Introduction to Bézier Curves
* What are are Bézier curves.
* Why we’re using them for our pin.
* Drawing your first Bézier curve.

## Spin In Blender (Rotational Extrusion)
* Convert the curve to a mesh object.
* Learn that a curve is still editable.
* Using the spin tool we will make our pin.

## Assigning Materials To Faces
* Introduce the material properties panel.
* How to create & name a material.
* About users of materials & “deleting” materials.
* How to assign a material to a face.

## Exporting Models With Materials
* How a .blend file may appear elsewhere.
* How to export as a .fbx file with materials.
* How using .blend is “leaner”.
* About smooth shading & normals.
* Why you may want multiple levels of detail.

## Creating Collider Meshes
* How to control the number of vertices.
* Creating a Convex Hull.
* Introducing the Decimate modifier.

## Choosing The Right Sphere
* Learn that the sphere is the defining shape.
* The mesh topology can vary greatly.
* UV sphere, ico sphere and cube!
* Brief look at subdivision modifier.

## BP16 Subdividing an Edge and To Sphere
* Use the Subdivision tool to add edge geometry.
* Use ‘to sphere’ to create a circular hole.
